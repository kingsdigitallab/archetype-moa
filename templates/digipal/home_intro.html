    <strong>Models of Authority: Scottish Charters and the Emergence of Government</strong> is a resource for the study of the contents, 
    script and physical appearance of the corpus of Scottish royal charters which survives from 1100â€“1250. 
    Through close examination of the palaeographic features of the charters, the project will explore the evidence for developments 
    in the practices and perception of royal government during a crucial period in Scottish history.
